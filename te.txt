import mlflow
with mlflow.start_run():
  mlflow.log_param('parameter name', 'value')
  mlflow.log_metric('metric name', 1)



 the tracking uri is this

  mlflow.set_tracking_uri("https://dagshub.com/ganeshkarli19/MLOPS_MLFLOW.mlflow")


Avoid the registry call — save locally and upload artifacts
This is the simplest, most reliable approach with remote tracking servers 
that don’t implement registry APIs. Save the sklearn model to a local folder and 
then mlflow.log_artifacts() that folder (you already had this idea commented out). Example:
